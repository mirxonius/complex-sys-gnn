# complex-sys-gnn
This repository contains the detailed work and numerical experiments performed for my Master's thesis in physics.
## Overview
The vaugeness of the title is because the projcet itself covers significant breadth. The general idea is to use graph neural networks to predict properties of a variety of complex systems e.g. molecules, particle jets, folding cloths in the wind. Considering the fact that most properties of physical systems obey certain symetries the focus is to construct equivariant models that can, hopefully, model the system with fewer parameters and generalize better.
