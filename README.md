This repository contains the detailed work and numerical experiments performed for my Master's thesis in physics.
## Overview
The initial idea was to make a modular API for training and testing equivariant (and regular) graph neural networks in a variety of systems. So far the only stabile version contains learning molecular dynamics. Future work may contian more physical systems such as: smooth particle hydrodynamics, mesh based simulations, electron densities and many more so stay tuned!
